When you watch many episodes of a long series of movies or tv shows or you read tons of books of a novel series, and after a long period the producers of that series release a new season but you almost forgot what happened in previous seasons. This application will give you a recap and help you to remember what happened in the older seasons 🌟.

**NOTE:**
